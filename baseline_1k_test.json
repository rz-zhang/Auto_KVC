        "Prison Link Cymru, a charity that helps ex-offenders find accommodation, reported a high number of referrals in 2015-16. The charity claims that investing in housing for ex-offenders would be cheaper than jailing them. The Welsh Government removed the right for prison leavers to be given priority for accommodation in 2015, which has led to a shortage of suitable housing for men. The charity suggests building more one-bedroom flats could help ease the problem. Official figures show that only 830 one-bedroom properties were built in the year to March 2016, out of a total of 6,900 new properties in Wales. Homeless charity Emmaus agrees that there is a lack of support available and suggests connecting people with the services they need. The Welsh Government claims that its national pathway for homeless services has prevented many people from losing their home whilst serving their prison sentence and is providing 20,000 new affordable homes in the next five years. However, the charity and some individuals argue that more needs to be done to address the issue.",

        "A study published in the journal Cell found that a modified \"fasting-mimicking diet\" can reverse symptoms of diabetes in animal experiments. The diet, which involves a low-calorie, low-protein, low-carbohydrate diet for five days, followed by 25 days of eating normally, was found to regenerate beta cells in the pancreas, which are responsible for detecting sugar in the blood and releasing insulin. The study also found benefits in both type 1 and type 2 diabetes in mouse experiments, and further tests on tissue samples from people with type 1 diabetes produced similar effects. Experts say the findings are \"potentially very exciting\" and could become a new treatment for the disease. However, Dr. Longo warns that people should not try this diet without medical guidance. Further human trials are needed to confirm the results.",
        "The proposed merger between Essilor, the world's largest manufacturer of lenses, and Luxottica, the leading frame manufacturer, has raised concerns about the impact on competition and customer choice in the eyewear industry. The combined company, EssilorLuxottica, would have a significant market share and could potentially control the supply of lenses and frames, leading to reduced choice and higher prices for customers. Some industry experts have expressed concerns that the merger could lead to a stranglehold on the supply of high-end glasses, with some rivals giving up. The European Commission has launched an inquiry into the proposed merger to determine whether it is in the public interest. The merger has also raised concerns about the impact on smaller, independent opticians and wholesalers. The industry is already highly competitive, with hundreds of smaller manufacturers and related businesses, and the merger could lead to a further consolidation of the market. The combined company would have a significant impact on the industry, with the potential to control the supply of lenses and frames, and could potentially lead to higher prices and reduced choice for customers.

        "British Cycling's World Class Programme has been accused of \"ageism\" and having \"zero regard\" for athlete welfare by Olympic silver medallist Wendy Houvenaghel. She is the latest high-profile cyclist to come forward after Jess Varnish, Nicole Cooke and Emma Pooley criticised the programme. Houvenaghel claims she was left out of the 2012 Olympic team due to ageism and was subjected to bullying and harassment. British Cycling has accepted a draft report's findings and has put in place a 39-point action plan to address cultural and behavioural shortcomings. The organisation has also apologised for instances where it has fallen short in its commitment to athlete welfare. A government-commissioned review into safety and wellbeing in British sport is due to be published imminently. Houvenaghel's comments come as part of a wider debate about the balance between winning and athlete welfare in British sport. Dame Sarah Storey, a 14-time Paralympic gold medallist, has also spoken out on the issue, saying that elite level sport in Britain is \"cut-throat\" but there are \"no excuses for crossing that line\" into bullying.",
        "Kareem Badr and his friends bought the Hideout comedy club in Austin, Texas in 2009 for $20,000, despite it not being profitable at the time. With no business experience, they worked hard to improve the club and now employ 25 part-time and contract workers. The club has expanded and is now thriving, with Badr able to quit his day job and draw a salary from the club.

The article also quotes comedians and industry experts, including Stephen Rosenfield, who says that stand-up comedy is entering a new golden age, and Steve Byrne, who emphasizes the importance of hard work and writing to succeed as a comedian.

The decision was influenced by the complexity of separating BT's pension scheme, which has a \u00a340 billion asset and a \u00a310 billion deficit. Ofcom instead plans to introduce a new board and articles of association to govern Openreach, the company's internet infrastructure provider, and give directors a duty to serve customers as well as shareholders. This move has the potential to create conflicts and may ultimately lead to a court battle and a full break-up of the company.

The move will result in job losses among both academic and non-academic staff, but the university aims to avoid compulsory redundancies.

Many US scientists are copying data onto servers outside the government's control, fearing that the Trump administration will curb access to climate and other research. The Trump team has been criticized for its anti-climate rhetoric, with one adviser comparing scientists who support the mainstream view on global warming to flat-Earthers. Some researchers are taking a pessimistic view, encouraging colleagues and students to make copies of data, while others believe that the change of administration is a good moment to review the type of scientific questions that US researchers are asking. The field of climate research is concerned about nominations to key government areas and attempts by the Trump transition team to obtain a list of employees who had worked on climate change. The Energy department has refused to comply with the request, and the Trump team has now said the questionnaire was \"not authorised\". Many researchers are worried that the anti-climate tone being struck by the incoming administration will have many serious consequences for scientists trying to do their jobs in real world situations.

        "A suspect, referred to as BM, has appeared in court accused of breaching a Terrorism Prevention and Investigation Measure (TPim) by failing to contact a monitoring company and report to a police station twice in January. This is believed to be the first alleged breach of a TPim to be taken to court. The Home Office has refused to comment on the case, but the police will investigate and prosecute where viable.

        "Russia's singer Julia Samoilova was banned from participating in the Eurovision Song Contest in Ukraine due to her performance in Crimea, which is annexed by Russia. Ukraine's decision was seen as a response to Russia's annexation of Crimea and its involvement in the conflict in eastern Ukraine. Russia had previously called for a boycott of Eurovision and had accused Ukraine of violating the contest's rules by allowing a song about the deportation of Crimean Tatars to be performed. The ban created a headache for Eurovision organizers and Russia declined an offer to participate by satellite from Moscow. The incident has been seen as part of a wider pattern of Russia trying to undermine Western institutions and Western liberal ideas. The security in Kiev is tight ahead of the contest, and there are concerns about further provocations from Russia. Instead of singing at Eurovision, Julia Samoilova will be performing in Crimea, which is seen as another political message from Moscow.",

        "South Africa's government has proposed a national minimum wage of around R3,500 (about $240) per month to combat income poverty and inequality. However, critics argue that this could lead to more job losses as employers may struggle to afford the higher wages. The government plans to consult on the issue and hopes to introduce the minimum wage within two years. The proposed wage is seen as insufficient by some, with one expert suggesting that a household needs around R12,000 ($800) to be sustained. The ruling African National Congress supports the proposal, while the Economic Freedom Fighters call for a higher minimum wage of at least R4,500 ($300). The country is facing a potential downgrade to sub-investment grade by credit ratings agencies due to concerns over labor unrest and the economy.",
        "The death of Ethiopian Prime Minister Meles Zenawi has raised concerns about a potential power struggle in Addis Ababa, which could have negative consequences for the region.

However, there is also hope that Ethiopia has the institutional mechanisms to ensure a smooth transition and maintain policy continuity in Somalia. The situation is closely watched, as the Horn of Africa is already experiencing tensions and conflicts in various countries. The death of Meles has also raised questions about his legacy and the future of Ethiopia, which has been a key player in regional politics.",

        "Jeremy Corbyn's Labour party is proposing to abolish university tuition fees in England, making education free for students. This move is seen as a bold step, with the party costing the removal of fees at \u00a311.2bn per year.

In Liberia and the Democratic Republic of Congo, designating forest reserves could displace as many as 1.3 million people. The study highlights the need to recognize the rights of indigenous communities who have been living in these areas for centuries and have a vested interest in protecting the forests. The report also estimates the costs of compensating people for the loss of their lands, ranging from $200m to over $1bn. The main argument for setting up reserves is to protect biodiversity and combat climate change. However, experts argue that it is more effective to help indigenous communities protect their forests, as they are active protectors of the land and can maintain more carbon per hectare than protected areas.",

        "The article discusses the potential financial implications of a Leave vote in the UK's EU referendum. It highlights the potential risks to the stability of commercial banks, the impact on exchange rates, and the possible responses from central banks. The article explains the measures that central banks could take to maintain financial stability, including providing liquidity to banks, intervening in foreign exchange markets, and using interest rates and quantitative easing to curb currency movements. It also notes that the European Central Bank could potentially use its bond-buying programme to address government debt problems in the eurozone. The article concludes that the timescale for these measures varies, with some options needing to be implemented quickly, while others may take longer.  Overall, the article suggests that central banks are prepared to take action to maintain financial stability in the event of a Leave vote.  It also notes that the potential risks and responses are complex and could have far-reaching implications for the global economy.  In particular, it highlights the potential for a general flight from riskier assets, which could lead to higher borrowing costs for countries such as Spain and Italy.

        "The Scottish Index of Multiple Deprivation (SIMD) has been published, showing that Ferguslie Park in Renfrewshire is the most deprived area in Scotland for the second consecutive time. Glasgow has 56 of the 100 most deprived areas, while Edinburgh has six. Renfrewshire Council is working to tackle poverty in the area, but the Scottish government and opposition parties have different views on how to address the issue. The SIMD index is used to identify areas of high deprivation and inform policy and funding decisions. The Scottish government says it will continue to work to tackle poverty and deprivation, while the opposition parties argue that more needs to be done to address the issue. The index breaks down Scotland into 6,976 \"datazones\" and ranks levels of deprivation on seven criteria, including income, employment, health, education, housing, access to services and crime. The statisticians say \"deprived\" does not just mean \"poor\" or \"low income\", but can also mean people have fewer resources and opportunities in areas such as health and education. The Scottish government says the index will help them target policies and funding to areas of high deprivation. The opposition parties argue that more needs to be done to address the issue and that the Scottish government's policies",

        "The article discusses the recent positive steroids test of a Scottish rugby player, Sam Chalmers, and the pressure on young players to take steroids to get ahead in the sport. The author, John Beattie, argues that the pressure to get big and strong is a major factor, and that players are often tempted to take shortcuts to achieve their goals. He also notes that the IRB has a high success rate in detecting drug use, with only 1.4% of elite level players testing positive. The author concludes that while Chalmers may have made a mistake, he is not alone, and that there are likely many other players who are tempted to take steroids but have not been caught. He also suggests that the use of steroids is not limited to professional players, and that young players may be tempted to take them to get ahead in the sport. Overall, the article raises questions about the pressures on young players to take steroids and the need for education and support to help them make healthy choices.",

        "According to a study by Prof Les Mayhew, the gap in life expectancy between men and women in England and Wales is narrowing. Men's life expectancy has increased by six years in the past 20 years, mainly due to a decline in smoking rates. If this trend continues, both sexes could have an average life expectancy of 87 by 2030. The study also suggests that men are adopting healthier lifestyles, leading to a convergence in life expectancy. However, women still have a slight advantage overall, and the gap may not completely close due to factors such as boys being more likely to die in their first year of life and take up dangerous sports or be involved in fatal accidents. Prof David Leon notes that the gap in life expectancy is closing in some countries, but is still significant in others, particularly in countries with lower levels of life expectancy. Overall, the study suggests that men's life expectancy is increasing faster than women's, but the gap is narrowing.",

Fitzel, who has experience working with the Czech national team, suggests that a bigger league would allow for more games, which would improve youth development. However, he also acknowledges that a 16-team league has its pitfalls, such as potentially leading to a decrease in the number of games played.

        "Bertrand Piccard, a pilot, is attempting to circumnavigate the globe using only the energy of the sun. He is flying a single-seat, propeller-driven aircraft called Solar Impulse, which has a wingspan bigger than a jumbo but weighs little more than a large car. The journey is the seventh leg of the project, and Piccard will try to stay awake for much of the time, taking only short catnaps. The aircraft needs clear skies and favourable winds to achieve peak performance, and Piccard will be monitored from a control room in Monaco throughout the journey. The distance to Kalaeloa airport on Hawaii's O'ahu island is more than 8,000km, and if Piccard encounters a major technical problem, he can turn around and head back to China or Japan. The purpose of the Solar Impulse project is to demonstrate the potential of clean technologies more generally. If successful, Piccard will set several aviation records, including the longest-duration journey for a single-seater plane. LEG 1: 9 March.

        "The Metropolitan Police has announced a plan to increase the number of armed officers on the streets of London and across England and Wales in response to recent terrorist attacks in Europe. The plan aims to make the capital a \"hostile\" environment for would-be attackers and to have enough armed police available to quickly respond to an atrocity. The Met has already said it will increase the number of armed officers in London by 600 to 2,800, and a further 900 armed officers will be planned for the rest of England and Wales. The Police Federation of England and Wales has expressed concern about the time it will take to fully train the 1,500 recruits planned nationally, saying it may take two years. The Met's Commissioner, Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, has said that the increased firearms teams will be patrolling randomly around the clock. The move comes after a series of attacks in Europe, including the Nice attack in France, which killed 84 people. The Met's plan aims to accelerate how quickly specialist firearms officers can reach a scene of an atrocity, and to have a second dedicated PC in every London ward by the end of next year. However, some have expressed concerns about the sight of police carrying heavy weapons, and the potential for police brutality",
        "Italy's parliament has passed a law that guarantees a majority of seats to the party that wins the most votes in an election, in an effort to end the country's era of revolving governments and unstable coalitions. The law, which is expected to come into force next year, awards 340 out of 630 seats to any party that wins more than 40% of the national vote, and allows for a second-round run-off between the two parties with the most votes if no party reaches the threshold. Critics have accused the prime minister, Matteo Renzi, of trying to consolidate his grip on power and have boycotted the vote. Renzi has also promised to further transform the Italian system by abolishing the Senate and replacing it with a non-elected body with lesser powers.",

        "The Dominican Republic has a long history of Haitian migration, with many Haitians living and working in the country without proper documentation. In 2013, the country's highest court ruled that children born to undocumented migrants were not automatically eligible for Dominican nationality. Thousands of Haitians were asked to \"regulate their status\" and those who did not meet the deadline were forced to leave the country. The Catholic Church has played a key role in the migration crisis, with some priests defending the rights of the returnees while others have been criticized for promoting a policy of division. The crisis has exposed divisions within the Catholic Church in Hispaniola, with some priests advocating for a more compassionate approach to the migrants.

The CST also suggests that publicly-funded field trials be conducted to test \"public good\" GM crop varieties, which could include traits such as nutritional enhancement or climate-proofing. The report argues that GM crops have been shown to be safe and could be necessary for the UK to grow its own food supply, rather than relying on imports. However, the environmental group Friends of the Earth opposes GM crops, citing concerns about their impact on the environment and food security. Other experts argue that GM crops could be a valuable tool in addressing global food security challenges, but that changing regulations would be necessary to make it possible for scientists to conduct field trials and develop GM varieties that benefit society.

        "The UK government is planning to scrap the paper system for car tax discs in October, replacing it with an electronic system that allows drivers to pay by monthly direct debit. Concerns were raised about job losses at the DVLA, but the minister has assured that while some job roles may change, the agency will redeploy staff to other areas rather than making redundancies. The change is expected to reduce the number of job opportunities at the DVLA, but the minister has committed to redeployment rather than redundancies.

        "The England and Wales Cricket Board (ECB) has introduced a new pitch standard to improve the quality of pitches, and Worcestershire County Cricket Club's director of cricket, Steve Rhodes, believes it has already made a positive impact. Rhodes says the new standard has led to more consistent and challenging pitches, which has helped to separate the best players from the rest. He also believes that the new standard has made it more difficult for bowlers to take wickets, but that this is a positive development as it means that batsmen have to work harder to score runs. Worcestershire has had two Championship matches so far, both of which have been draws, and has produced eight centuries, with five coming in the match against Gloucestershire and three more in their last game with Essex. Rhodes believes that the new standard will help to sort out the best players and make the game more competitive.",

The Kurds in Iraq and Syria are seeking independence, and the Islamic State (IS) is erasing borders. The agreement was a product of colonial powers imposing their will on the region, and its legacy is a patchwork of minority states held together by strongmen or central governments. The future of the region is uncertain, with some calling for a new formula for the region and others seeking to redraw the map. The Kurds have already established a de facto state in northern Iraq and are seeking independence, while IS has already peaked and is now fighting to survive. The struggle is over whether different communities can live together within the existing borders or whether new frontiers will have to be drawn.

The IMF's gloomy projection is attributed to its assumption of a weak minority government after the election, which would lead to higher spending. The IMF also believes the OBR is too optimistic about growth and tax revenues in the latter years of the next parliament.

        "Many people who rely on their savings income are worse off than ever before due to plummeting savings rates. Since the financial crisis, savings rates have fallen significantly, with tax-free Isas, fixed rate bonds, and easy access accounts all at or near their lowest points. This has had a devastating impact on those at or near retirement who had hoped to use their savings to pay their bills. The fall in rates has come across the board, with significant reductions from major banks and building societies. The average return from easy access accounts has dropped from over 3% in 2012 to under 1.3%, while tax-free Isa rates are at their lowest ever. Experts warn that very low savings rates are likely to be the \"new normal\" due to the precarious economic situation. The situation is particularly concerning for those at or near retirement, who are worried about the impact on their income and ability to pay for care. The uncertainty surrounding the EU referendum has added to the confusion, with some speculating that a vote to leave could lead to higher interest rates, while others think that uncertainty could prompt the Bank of England to cut its base rate again.

        "Researchers have found that a plant called Jatropha curcas can capture up to 25 tonnes of carbon dioxide from the atmosphere every year, making it a potential solution to climate change. The plant is already grown as a biofuel in some parts of the world and can thrive in harsh conditions such as deserts. The researchers believe that planting jatropha on a large scale could be a good, short-term solution to climate change, as it would absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and provide an economic return. However, critics argue that the idea could have unforeseen negative impacts, such as driving up food prices and polluting the land. They also question the fairness of the idea, as it would require someone else's land to be used for the plantations. The researchers are hoping to develop larger trials in desert areas of Oman or Qatar. The cost of curbing carbon dioxide via the planting of trees is estimated to be between 42 and 63 euros per tonne, making it competitive with other techniques such as carbon capture and storage.",

        "Satellite images show that Emperor Penguins are able to adapt to changing sea ice conditions by relocating to alternative breeding sites on ice shelves. The penguins travel long distances to find these sites, which are often faced with cliffs that are tens of meters high. The study suggests that the penguins are able to meet and beat some of the challenges that may lie ahead due to climate change. However, the cost of this adaptation is still unknown and further research is needed to understand the implications for other penguin populations.",
        "The Royal Zoological Society of Scotland has introduced a male polar bear, Arktos, to a female polar bear, Victoria, at its Highland Wildlife Park in an attempt to breed cubs. The pair will live together for about two weeks and if successful, Victoria will not fall pregnant until August to September time. This is part of a wider effort to conserve polar bears, which are classified as \"vulnerable\" on the International Union Conservation of Nature's Red List of Threatened Species. However, animal welfare organisations have suggested that tackling climate change to better protect wild bears should be the focus of conservation efforts rather than captive breeding. The pair have appeared to have bonded well and if successful, any cubs would not come out of the birthing den until March to April 2017. This is the first time polar bear cubs have been born in the UK in almost 25 years.",

        "The article reports on the sentencing of Oscar Pistorius, the South African athlete who was found guilty of culpable homicide for the murder of his girlfriend, Reeva Steenkamp. Pistorius was given a five-year jail sentence, with the possibility of being released after serving 10 months. The judge, Thokozile Masipa, said she considered the sentence to be fair and just, taking into account Pistorius's disability and his contributions to society. The prosecution had called for a minimum 10-year term, while the defence had argued for community service and house arrest. The case has been widely followed in South Africa and around the world, and has sparked debate about gun control and the treatment of women in the country. Pistorius was taken away in an armoured police van to Pretoria's Kgosi Mampuru prison, where he will be held in a one-man cell in the hospital wing. He will be eligible for release after serving a sixth of his sentence, or 10 months, for good behaviour. (Word count: 450) ...more\nHide\nWhat do you think of the sentence given to Oscar Pistorius?

        "The article describes a Republican debate in the style of a Victorian fairground, where the candidates take turns to \"punch\" and \"attack\" Donald Trump, the front-runner, with questions and criticisms. The debate takes place at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California. The article highlights the exchanges between Trump and his opponents, including Rand Paul, Scott Walker, and Carly Fiorina, who delivers a particularly effective \"gotcha\" moment when she responds to Trump's previous insult about her appearance. The article concludes that while Trump remains the focal point, his opponents are prepared to fight back and the circus of the US presidential election continues.

        "The Large Hadron Collider (LHC) has failed to find evidence of supersymmetry, a theory that proposes the existence of more massive versions of particles. The LHCb detector has measured the decay of a particle known as a Bs meson into two muons, and the result is not consistent with many models of supersymmetry. The finding is a significant blow to the theory, which had been hoped to explain some inconsistencies in the Standard Model of subatomic physics. While the result does not rule out the possibility of superparticles, it suggests that they may not be responsible for dark matter. Theorists will have to find alternative explanations for the inconsistencies in the Standard Model. The result has been met with mixed reactions from physicists, with some considering it a serious blow to supersymmetry and others seeing it as consistent with some models. The LHC will continue to search for evidence of new physics, but the result has put pressure on theorists to find alternative explanations.",

        "The first shipment of the Ebola vaccine, developed by GlaxoSmithKline and the US National Institutes of Health, is expected to arrive in Liberia on Friday. The vaccine will be tested on 30,000 volunteers, including frontline health workers, to determine if it provides any protection against the virus. While experts say it may be difficult to establish whether the jab offers any protection due to the falling number of Ebola cases, it is still important to conduct the trial to determine the vaccine's effectiveness and prepare for future outbreaks. The vaccine has been found to have an acceptable safety profile in initial testing, and the company hopes to immunize the first volunteer in the next few weeks. If the vaccine is deemed safe and effective, it could potentially be used in mass immunization campaigns to prevent future outbreaks.",

The charity is calling for increased awareness and fundraising to help fight the disease, and is urging people to seek medical attention if they notice any unusual symptoms.

        "Lufthansa lost an appeal to a Frankfurt labour court, but is making a further legal challenge to stop a pilot's strike that will affect around 100,000 passengers. The strike is part of a long-running pay dispute between the airline and the Vereinigung Cockpit pilots' union. The strike will affect short and medium-haul flights from Germany from 00:01 to 23:59 local time. Flights by Lufthansa's other airlines are not affected. The union is calling for a 3.7% pay rise for pilots dating back to 2012, while Lufthansa offered a 2.5% increase over six years. The strike is the 15th organized by the union since April 2014. Lufthansa is facing increasing competition from budget rivals and is offering a lower pay rise than the union is demanding. The airline is also facing a separate dispute with cabin crew at its low-cost subsidiary, Eurowings, which led to the cancellation of over 60 flights on Tuesday. The strike could go late into Tuesday evening as Lufthansa makes a further legal challenge.",
        "The Glastonbury Festival was charged with a single charge of polluting a river with sewage in 2014.

The seriousness of the breach is yet to be decided, with the festival facing a fine of up to \u00a3300,000 if it is deemed a category one offence.

        "The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) has released its Green Budget, which warns that the UK's finances still have a long way to go to recover from the financial crisis. The report states that the UK is planning the largest fiscal consolidation out of 32 advanced economies, and that public spending will need to fall to its lowest share of national income since 1948. The IFS also notes that spending cuts so far have been less than planned, and that the coalition government has implemented fewer real spending cuts than originally planned. The report highlights the central economic choice facing voters in May, with the Tories wanting an overall surplus by 2018 and surpluses thereafter, and Labour wanting to balance only the current budget by 2020. The IFS provides numerical examples of the differing approaches of the three main UK parties, and notes that 98% of the remaining consolidation is currently planned to come from spending cuts rather than higher taxes. The report concludes that the UK has a long way to go to recover from the financial crisis, and that the public finances will need to be managed carefully in the coming years.",

        "Cesc Fabregas has joined Chelsea from Barcelona for an undisclosed fee, signing a five-year contract. The 27-year-old Spaniard spent three years at Barca but struggled to secure a regular midfield role, and has now returned to the Premier League to fill the void left by Frank Lampard's departure.

He suffered bone fractures and internal injuries, but was \"fine\" and \"a very lucky man.\" His friends reported that he had no recollection of the incident and was awake and laughing on Monday. The incident was not suspicious and was attributed to Mr. Stilwell being locked out of his apartment and attempting to climb down from his neighbor's balcony. Despite the severity of the fall, Mr. Stilwell's survival was attributed to breaking his fall on the roof of an adjacent building, 13 floors below. Experts noted that survival from falls of this height are extremely rare. (Word count: 266)",

The Fed chairwoman, Janet Yellen, said the rise was a \"modest shift\" and that the economy would need only \"gradual\" increases in the short term. However, she also signaled that the new Trump administration could lead to faster rate rises next year. The Fed expects three rate rises next year, up from two previously predicted. The rate rise was widely expected and followed the last increase a year ago. The Fed also published its economic forecasts for the next three years, which suggest that the Federal Funds rate may rise to 1.4% next year, 2.1% in 2018, and 2.9% in 2019.

        "The Wales Bill, which aims to extend the transfer of powers to Wales, has been approved by the Welsh Assembly. The bill has been criticized by Plaid Cymru, who claim it would reduce the assembly's law-making powers, while UKIP has opposed it due to the lack of a referendum on devolving income tax powers. The bill will now return to Parliament for the final stages of the legislative process. The First Minister of Wales, Carwyn Jones, has recommended that the assembly vote in favor of the bill, saying it \"takes Wales forward\", but has also acknowledged that it is not perfect and that there is a need for improvement in some areas. The bill introduces a system of powers that are reserved to Westminster, with everything else assumed to be devolved. However, the reserved powers model has been criticized for being unclear and for potentially leading to conflicts between the Welsh and UK governments. The bill also includes a number of reservations, which have been criticized for being too vague and for potentially limiting the assembly's powers. Overall, the bill is seen as a significant step forward for Welsh devolution, but it is not without its critics.",

The authors, who are involved in the protests, explain how the initial Facebook invitation to protest sparked a wave of online activity, which in turn helped to mobilize people on the ground. They emphasize that the revolution was not solely the result of social media, but rather the combination of online and offline organizing. The authors also highlight the importance of face-to-face interactions and community building in the square, where people from different backgrounds have come together to protest. They express pride in the achievements of the revolution and the sense of community that has developed among protesters.

        "A study of 712 Italian-American mafia members in the 1960s found that their income increased by 7.5-8.5% for each additional year of education.

However, on average, the mafia members left education a year earlier than other white men of a similar age in their neighborhoods. The study suggests that education has a protective effect against getting involved with crime, but that better-educated criminals may be more successful in their illegal activities. The study also found that private returns to education exist not only in legitimate but also in illegitimate activities that require a certain degree of complexity.

        "The Premier League side led when Calum Chambers superbly curled in from 18 yards with the outside of his foot. Championship side Burnley hit back as Sam Vokes headed in Tendayi Darikwa's cross and an Alex Iwobi interception denied Andre Gray after the break. Sanchez - making his first start since November - finished coolly to win it. The Chile international - who has made just one substitute appearance since suffering a hamstring injury in November - was lively throughout and turned in Alex Oxlade-Chamberlain's cross after Darikwa was dispossessed in midfield. There can be no doubt the holders deserved a place in Sunday's draw as they enjoyed the lion's share of possession and chances, though Burnley created a nervy finish. The impressive Gray caught sight of goal late on but could not get meaningful power in his shot and as the visitors threw bodies forward, substitute Theo Walcott missed a glorious chance to add a third on the break as he failed to round Tom Heaton.

Leicester director of rugby Richard Cockerill became the third boss to be sacked in eight months, with five coaches leaving in five years before 2016. The Rugby Coaches Association (RCA) has expressed concern over the increasing pressure on coaches, with the timing of recent departures being more damning than the increase in sackings themselves. The RCA's Richard Moon believes the growing popularity of Premiership rugby and increased riches in the game are contributing to the pressure on coaches, with the need for short-term success driving the trend. Exeter boss Baxter suggests that the demands of crowds, rugby clubs, and TV money are contributing to the pressure, while Leicester lock Ed Slater believes the recent sackings are a result of the club's lack of success in recent years. The article also quotes Sale director of rugby Steve Diamond, who denies the turnover of coaches can be compared to football, and Chris Jones, who suggests that the competitiveness of the Premiership and the influence of private investment are contributing to the pressure on coaches. Overall, the article highlights the growing pressure on rugby coaches and the increasing trend of sackings in the sport.",

He has won both of his games in charge, but the club is still considering other candidates for the job. Roy Hodgson and Nigel Pearson have been linked with the position.",

        "Edvald Boasson Hagen of Norway won the 17th stage of the Tour de France, beating a breakaway group of 14 riders over the final climb. Thomas Voeckler, the French rider who had been wearing the yellow jersey, lost 27 seconds to his main rivals and now trails Cadel Evans by 1 minute 18 seconds. Alberto Contador and Andy Schleck tested Voeckler and Evans with a burst of acceleration, but the descent proved more profitable for Contador as he pulled back time. The stage was marked by a 14-strong breakaway that established an advantage of more than seven minutes over the peloton, but the general classification contenders were content to save their aggression for the final ascent. The stage also saw a strong showing from Team Sky, with Rigoberto Uran and Geraint Thomas holding the jersey for the race's best young rider, and Boasson Hagen emerging as a consistent threat at the end of each stage. Mark Cavendish retained his green jersey after picking up a point at the intermediate checkpoint. The stage finished in Pinerolo, Italy.

        "The Suffolk Fire and Rescue Service is facing cuts of \u00a31.3m, which could result in the loss of 50-60 on-call firefighters, the scrapping of 7 fire engines, and the potential closure of Wrentham fire station. The service is also considering replacing a fire engine in Sudbury with a smaller \"rapid response\" vehicle. The public consultation on the plans is now underway, and the fire brigades union has expressed deep concern about the proposed cuts.

        "The UK government is considering military action in Syria against IS, but the legal basis for this action is uncertain. While there is no legal requirement for Parliamentary approval, the government has said it will seek a Commons vote. The legal arguments around intervention in Syria are shaped by the complexities and conflicting interpretations of international law. The UK could justify action on self-defence grounds, but this would require showing that military action was needed to prevent attacks on the UK or its citizens emanating from Syria. Alternatively, the UK could argue for humanitarian intervention, citing the need to protect civilians from the Syrian government or IS. The government's position is also influenced by customary international law, which allows for the right of \"hot pursuit\" of IS across borders. However, legal experts are divided on the legality of air strikes without specific Security Council authorisation.

The UV light, known as coronas, is released when electricity builds up in cables and is released into the air. The researchers found that most mammals can see UV light, unlike humans and monkeys, and that the avoidance of power lines by animals is not just due to the physical presence of the cables, but also the flashing UV light. The study suggests that the random and unpredictable nature of the flashes can be particularly problematic for animals, and that power companies should consider ways to address the issue.

        "Elgan Varney, 33, was accused of raping a 22-year-old student, Hannah Stubbs, in 2014. The student took her own life in 2015, and the CPS later dropped the charges against Varney due to lack of evidence. Varney was cleared of all charges, and expressed his condolences to the family of the victim. He also called for a change in the law to provide anonymity to those charged with but not convicted of sexual offences. The university where the alleged rape occurred has said they will be in contact with Varney over the coming weeks.

        "A retired professor from Bangor University has identified a small Roman fort in West Yorkshire as the true location of Camelot, the legendary court of King Arthur. The fort, located at Slack, was once called Camulodunum, which over time would have been reduced to Camelot. The professor believes that this site would have been a strategic stronghold for the Celtic-speaking Britons who were defending against the Anglo-Saxon invaders around AD500. This theory contradicts previous best guesses for the location of Camelot, which included locations in Wales, Somerset, and Cornwall. The professor's findings were revealed during the launch of a new centre for the history and culture of the book at Bangor University.",

        "The latest intake of Conservative MPs is the most Eurosceptic in the party's history, with a third wanting a fundamental renegotiation of the UK's relationship with Europe and another third wanting the UK to withdraw altogether. Many Tory MPs are being coy about their views, and only a small number have publicly declared their support for withdrawal. The government's leadership is seen as being supine on Europe, and the party's divisions over Europe are still raw. The eurozone crisis has given Eurosceptics a new opportunity to push for change, but the government's priority is economic recovery rather than Europe. The debate over Europe is likely to become more prominent in the run-up to the next election in 2015.",

He also accused the Tories of making the poorest bear the heaviest burden. David Cameron, the Conservative leader, has responded by saying that the Lib Dems are running away from their record. The Lib Dems have proposed raising the income tax threshold to \u00a312,500 by 2020, which they say will be funded partly by clamping down on tax avoidance and evasion. The party has also criticized Labour's plans for the deficit, saying they will borrow too much and increase debt interest payments. The Chief Secretary to the Treasury, Danny Alexander, has echoed the Lib Dem's call for fairness in taxation, while Labour has accused the Lib Dems of breaking their promises and giving tax cuts to millionaires.

The court papers allege that Prince Andrew had sexual relations with a woman, Virginia Roberts, who claims she was forced to sleep with him on three occasions between 1999 and 2002. The palace has denied the allegations, stating that they are \"without any foundation\". The woman has issued a statement saying she is \"looking forward to vindicating my rights as an innocent victim and pursuing all available recourse\". The case has the potential to damage Prince Andrew's reputation and the institution he represents. Alan Dershowitz, a lawyer and former Harvard law professor, has also been named in the court papers and is planning to take legal action against the woman. He believes that the allegations against Prince Andrew must be presumed to be false and that the woman should be required to speak under oath. The case is ongoing, and it remains to be seen how it will unfold.",

        "John Findlay, a survivor of child abuse at Aberlour House in Moray, Scotland, believes that money would be better spent supporting victims rather than conducting inquiries. He has not been contacted about giving evidence to the Scottish Abuse Inquiry, which is investigating historical abuse of children in care. Findlay's abuse was perpetrated by a teacher at the school, who is no longer alive. He believes that the inquiry is just another process and that there has been no real progress in helping victims. The Scottish government has established an inquiry into the abuse of children in care, which will focus on systemic institutional failures and has committed to providing support services for adult survivors.

        "Australia's economy grew 0.5% in the October-December 2014 period, beating expectations but still considered \"well below potential\". The country's central bank, the Reserve Bank of Australia, did not cut interest rates further, leading to a fall in Australian stocks. Economists believe more help may be needed to boost the economy, such as a lower Australian dollar or further interest rate cuts. Household consumption expenditure and higher inventories and trade contributed to the quarterly growth. However, domestic demand remains weak, with consumer spending and home construction offsetting the slump in mining investment. The economy expanded 2.3% annually, beating expectations. Economic growth in the March quarter of 2014 was 2.9%. The Australian economy is still adjusting to a post mining-boom landscape. 0.8% of the 0.9% growth came from higher inventories and trade.

        "A new study has found that the common cuckoo, a summer visitor to the UK, is in decline, and its migratory habits may be to blame. Scientists have tracked 42 male cuckoos and found that those from declining populations take a shorter route to Africa via Spain, which has a higher mortality rate. The researchers believe this may be due to challenging drought conditions or a lack of insect food, leading to lower fat stores for the hazardous journey. This study highlights the importance of understanding the annual cycle of migratory birds to address population declines.",

The 26-year-old Mexican driver had also been linked with Williams and Renault, but has decided to stay with the team that has been his home since 2014.

        "According to new research from Imperial College London, the gender gap between men and women's life expectancies is narrowing. In 1981, men were expected to live 6 years fewer than women, but by 2030, men are expected to live only 2 years fewer than women. The research suggests that the narrowing of the gap is largely due to the decline in smoking rates among men, which has been a major contributor to the gap. Other factors such as improvements in prevention and treatment of heart disease, and changes in occupation and lifestyle, may also be playing a role. While the exact reasons for the gender gap are still debated, the research suggests that it will continue to narrow in the future, with both men and women expected to live longer and healthier lives.",
